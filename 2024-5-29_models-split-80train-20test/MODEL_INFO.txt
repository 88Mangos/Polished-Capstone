training datasets and test dataset found in 
datasets -> splits.

each image is RGB, 64 by 64.
Training datasets:
1. ISIC 
2. ISIC + DiDI
3. ISIC + ArGI

Testing Dataset:
ISIC + DiDI
Exclude ArGI because these images are not guaranteed to be real

80% of ISIC will be used in training
80% of DiDI will be used in training
80% of ArGI will be used in training
20% of ISIC will go to testing
20% of DiDI will go to testing

Data Sources:
ISIC: N = 1972
DiDI: N = 656
ArGI: N = 656
